ECEC 355 Project 3: RISC-V Pipeline
By Cole Bardin (cab572)

Change Log:
- CPU core is broken into pipelined stages
- Each clock tick executes all pipelines
- Simulation is done when all stages are idle and PC is passed max
- Inter-stage registers are copied before the stages are executed
- Each stage updates the remote copy of their output inter-stage register
- EX->EX & MEM->EX forwarding is detected by forwarding unit
- Hazard detection unit will trigger ID and ID stalls on load hazards
- VERBOSE mode now outputs the info for each stage


Verbose mode for debug can be enabled by passing VERBOSE=1 option to Make.
If source code has not changed, Make will not rebuild with new flags.
You must 'make clean' before calling Make again with a different VERBOSE flag value.

Usage is still the same.

USAGE: ./RISCV_core <trace-file>
