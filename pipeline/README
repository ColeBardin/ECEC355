ECEC 355 Project 2: RISC-V Pipeline
By Cole Bardin (cab572)

Change Log:
- CPU core is broken into pipelined stages
- Each clock tick executes all pipelines
- Simulation is done when all stages are idle and PC is passed max
- Inter-stage registers are copied before the stages are executed
- Each stage updates the remote copy of their output inter-stage register
- EX->EX & MEM->EX forwarding is detected by forwarding unit
- Hazard detection unit will trigger ID and ID stalls on load hazards

Usage is still the same

USAGE: ./RISCV_core <trace-file>
