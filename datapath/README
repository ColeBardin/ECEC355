ECEC 355 Project 2: RISC-V Datapath
By Cole Bardin (cab572)

I updated my library to use a similar array of struct architecture to be more representative of instruction memory.
The codebase also still has the modificaitons to the c files so there is an instruction.c/h
The Makefile has been updated accordingly.

When building the project, an optional VERBOSE variable can be set to either 1 or 0 to control verbose debug messages.
If the source is has not been updated and but you are trying to compile with a different VERBOSE setting, run '$ make clean' first.
This is because Make will not recompile if the source has not changed, even if a variable input has changed

Usage is still the same

USAGE: ./RISCV_core <trace-file>
